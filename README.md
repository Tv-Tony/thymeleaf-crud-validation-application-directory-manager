This application utilizes a few Spring Technologies such as Spring JPA, Thymeleaf, Spring Web, and Spring Validation. The main endpoint /applications/list shows a directory that allows the user to manage applicants with CRUD methods. The application 
is also connected to a database, and has bootstrap templates to make the front end of the application look better. 

The main point of this project was to gain experience with thymeleaf and spring validation, I used a few validation techniques including 
the predefined given annotations, also defining error messages in a messages.properties file, adn creating my own custom annotation that implements Springs Constraint Validator interface. 
Below are some pictures of the project
